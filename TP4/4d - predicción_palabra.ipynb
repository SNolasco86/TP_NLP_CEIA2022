and my patience thin So I got me a new best friend With a pickup that puts you to shame And Cherry is her name And when I\\'m lonely, Cherry\\'s there And she plays along while I sing out my blues I could be crying and you don\\'t care You won\\'t call me back, you\\'re stubborn as a mule Maybe we could talk \\'bout things If you was made of wood and strings You might think I\\'ve gone too far I\\'m talking \\'bout my new guitar Wish I could say it breaks my heart Like you did in the beginning Its not that we grew apart A nightingale no longer singing Its something I know you can\\'t do Separate sex with emotion I sleep alone the sun comes up Your still clinging to that notion Every thing is slowing down River of no return Recognize my every sound There is nothing new to learn You\\'ll never get my mind right Like two ships passing in the night In the night, in the night Want the same thing where we lay Otherwise mines a different way A different way from where I\\'m going Oh, its you again listen this isn\\'t a reunion So sorry if I turn my head Yours is a familiar face But that don\\'t make your place safe In my bed, my bed, my bed I never thought my memory Of what we had could be intruded But I couldn\\'t let it be I needed it as much as you did Now its not hard to understand Why we just speak at night The only time I hold your hand Is to get the angle right Everything is slowing down River of no return You recognize my every sound There\\'s nothing new to learn You\\'ll never get my mind right Like two ships passing in the night In the night in the night Want the same thing where we lay Otherwise mine\\'s a different way A different way from where I\\'m going Oh, its you again listen this isn\\'t a reunion So sorry if I turn my head Yours is a familiar face But that don\\'t make your place safe In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed When you walk in the bar And you dressed like a star Rockin\\' your f me pumps And the men notice you With

When you walk in the bar, And you dressed like a star, Rockin\\' your F me pumps. And the men notice you, With your Gucci bag crew, Can\\'t tell who he\\'s lookin\\' to. Cause you all look the same, Everyone knows your name, And that\\'s you whole claim to fame. Never miss a night, Cause your dream in life, Is to be a footballers wife. You don\\'t like players, That\\'s what you say-a, But you really wouldn\\'t mind a millionaire. You don\\'t like ballers, They don\\'t do nothing for ya, But you\\'d love a rich man six foot two or taller. You\\'re more than a fan, Lookin\\' for a man, But you end up with one-nights-stands. He could be your whole life, If you got past one night, But that part never goes right. In the morning you\\'re vexed, He\\'s onto the next, And you didn\\'t even get no taste. Don\\'t be too upset, If they call you a skank, Cause like the news everyday you get pressed. You don\\'t like players, That\\'s what you say-a, But you really wouldn\\'t mind a millionaire. Or them big ballers, Don\\'t do nothing for ya. But you\\'d love a rich man six foot two or taller, You can\\'t sit down right, Cause you jeans are too tight, And your lucky its ladies night. With your big empty purse, Every week it gets worse, At least your breasts cost more than hers. So you did Miami, Cause you got there for free, But somehow you missed the plane. You did too much E, Met somebody, And spent the night getting caned. Without girls like you, There\\'d be no fun, We\\'d go to the club and not see anyone. Without girls like you, There\\'s no nightlife, All those men just go home to their wives. Don\\'t be mad at me, Cause you\\'re pushing thirty, And your old tricks no longer work. You should have known from the job, That you always get dumped, So dust off your fuck me pumps You\\'re wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end You\\'re wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved First time I swallowed, now you\\'re on your own I won\\'t return, forever you will wait You\\'re wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end First time I swallowed, now you\\'re on your own I won\\'t return, forever you will wait You\\'re wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end You\\'re wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved You\\'re wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end You\\'re wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved You\\'re wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end You\\'re wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved Simple sweet guitar Humbled by the bass So when the beat kicks in Everything falls into place And it overpowers me I can\\'t help but dance You can try to stop me now But you won\\'t get the chance Half time Time to think it through Consider the change See it from a different view Half time Time to think it through Consider the change Rhythm floods my heart The melody it feeds my soul The tune tears me apart And it swallows me whole You should thank your lucky stars \\'Cause the music is a gift And it\\'s stronger than all else Provides me with uplift Half time Time to think it through Consider the change See it from a different view Half time Time to think it through Consider the change My lyrics revealing Some natural vibe Some kind of laid back feeling Oh, just let it ride And when Frank Sinatra sings It\\'s too much to take So I sing the standard shit It pacifies my ache Half time Time to think it through Consider the change See it from a different view Half time Time to think it through Consider the change Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt You say, \"Why did you do it with him today?\" And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray \\'Cause you\\'re my fella, my guy Hand me your Stella and fly By the time I\\'m out the door You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself Like I knew I would I told ya I was troubled You know that I\\'m no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy He\\'s in the place, but I can\\'t get joy Thinking of you in the final throes This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter You say when we\\'re married \\'cause you\\'re not bitter There\\'ll be none of him no more I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself Like I knew I would I told ya I was troubled You know that I\\'m no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain We\\'re like how we were again I\\'m in the tub, you\\'re on the seat Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn My stomach drops, and my guts churn You shrug, and it\\'s the worst To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself Like I knew I would I told ya I was troubled You know that I\\'m no good I cheated myself Like I knew I would I told ya I was troubled Yeah, ya know that I\\'m no good Got back together with my man last night But I think I was dreaming, he didn\\'t feel quite right I pressed his chest under my fingertips Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips I\\'m confused and quizzical Funny don\\'tcha know I just wan get physical Let me tell ya how Do me good, I\\'ll tell you anything you want to hear Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good Do me good and all this craziness will disappear Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good It\\'s like he was designed with me in mind He\\'s so good from behind, he\\'s beautifully defined I miss him most of all when it got late Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight I\\'m confused and quizzical Funny don\\'tcha know I just wan get physical Let me tell ya how Do me good, I\\'ll tell you anything you want to hear Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good Do me good and all this craziness will disappear Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good I never wanted you to be my man I just wanted to see what you could do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I feel it my heart like you were there I never wanted you, many times when I tried to set you right, it\\'s just too hard I never wanted you to be my man but I really couldn\\'t control myself I can\\'t wait to get away from you And surprisingly you hate me too We only communicate when we need to fight But we are best friends...right?

That I live my life by And your attitude become a bore And I\\'m so tired I can\\'t even cry All I can ever be to you, Is a darkness that we knew, And this regret I had to get accustomed to, Once it was so right, When we were at our high, Waiting for you in the hotel at night, I knew I hadn\\'t met my match, But every moment we could snatch, I don\\'t know why I got so attached, It\\'s my responsibility, And you don\\'t owe nothing to me, But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away, The sun goes down, He takes the day but I\\'m grown, And in this grey, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own, I don\\'t understand, Why do I stress a man, When there\\'s so many better things at hand, We could a never had it all, We had to hit a wall, So this is inevitable withdrawal, Even if I stop wanting you, A perspective pushes through, I\\'ll be some next man\\'s other woman soon, I shouldn\\'t play myself again, I should just be my own best friend, Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men, He walks away, The sun goes down, He takes the day but I\\'m grown, And it\\'s okay, In this blue shade, My tears dry on their own, So we are history, Your shadow covers me The sky above, A blaze He walks away, The sun goes down, He takes the day but I\\'m grown, And it\\'s okay, In this blue shade My tears dry on their own, I wish I could say no regrets, And no emotional debts, And as we kiss goodbye the sun sets, So we are history, The shadow covers me, The sky above a blaze that only lovers see, He walks away, The sun goes down, He takes the day but I\\'m grown, And it\\'s okay, In this blue shade, My tears dry on their own, He walks away, The sun goes down, He takes the day but I\\'m grown, And it\\'s okay, My deep shade, My tears dry on their own He walks away, The sun goes down, He takes the day but I\\'m grown, And it\\'s okay, My deep shade, My tears dry She sits home and dreams That her man will leave his mark on her hand He\\'s not all he seems But she\\'s seen a dress, she has the flowers planned Now she won\\'t be happy Till she look down and sees the engagement ring It\\'s for security But she will be waiting years for her wedding [Chorus] For me it ain\\'t real It\\'s fools gold There too many fools sold Not an excuse oh For me it ain\\'t real It\\'s fools gold I don\\'t hear everything I\\'m told He won\\'t change her life He just chasing tail And wasting her time She calls herself his wife He calls her at 8 says be here by 9 She don\\'t notice how when she gets the ring It\\'s not a good fit So next time that they row She throws it out It goes to the last girl he hit [Chorus] So take the gold you find And for your own sake Hold it in your hand Now make sure you bite down And watch your tooth don\\'t break on that wedding band For me it ain\\'t real It\\'s fools gold There too many fools sold Not an excuse oh For me it ain\\'t real Yes it\\'s fools gold Every day I see you My hands were made for you And you always give me stress free point of view Pick you up after school Mister Magic, take a token Mister Magic, of my love Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Without you I\\'m misery Blue without my green All the songs sound better when you\\'re next to me Yeah, \\'cause you come naturally Mister Magic, take a token Mister Magic, of my love, love, love (Mister Magic) I see you through the smoke Laying on my bed I reach over for you And you so fresh you even make the standards new Burn the tip to get you through Mister Magic, take a token Mister Magic, of my love Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Mister Magic Mister Magic Mister Magic, waiting for the smoke to clear I\\'m waiting for the smoke to clear It\\'s always gone within two days. Follow my father, his extravagant ways. So if I got it I will spend it all, Camden and Parkway \\'til I hit a wall. I cross my fingers at the cash machine, As I check my balance I kiss the screen. I love it when it says I got the means, To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans. Chorus: (x2) Never lasts me long, Handle finance wrong, Blow it all on bags and shoes, Jazz \\'n blues. Standin\\' too deep at the bar today, Wait with impatience to throw my cash away. Four white Russians a JD and Coke, Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke. But that\\'s cool \\'cause I can borrow more from you, And I didn\\'t forget about that fifty pound, too. Tell you what, my advance is comin\\' through, I\\'ll take you out shoppin\\', Can you wait \\'til next June? Yeah. Chorus: Never lasts me long, Handle finance wrong (handle it wrong), Blow it all on bags and shoes, Jazz \\'n blues (jazz and blues). Never lasts me long (long), Handle finance wrong (wrong), Blow it all on bags and shoes (blow it all), Jazz \\'n blues.

Yo no quiero ser, El único que sabe Que alguien podría venir y apenas Dicen que el amor por mí, Estoy de pie temblando de tierra, Y estoy pensando que voy a perder, Estribillo: Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza, Estoy perdiendo mi mente, Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez. Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza, Estoy perdiendo mi mente, Estoy perdiendo a mi manera, Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. ¿Estás hablando conmigo? Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver, Pero es que lo que Siente esto debe ser. Mi amor es como bala Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda. No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo, Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más. Hasta que me aviso, Necesito saber en este momento Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo: Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza, Estoy perdiendo mi mente, Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez. Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza, Estoy perdiendo mi mente, Estoy perdiendo a mi manera, Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ... Pero chica que me pone nervioso, A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta. ¿Y qué va a tomar Para la celestial ... Me estás volviendo loco!
